TIME MASTER

USER MANUAL (OFFICIAL – AS-IS VERSION)

Product: Time Master
Role: Managing Director (BEIA – Becoming Everything I Am)
Purpose: Time stewardship, execution accountability, recovery from drift
Version: v1.0 (Live Use Manual – not roadmap)

⸻

1. What Time Master Is (In Plain English)

Time Master is not a chat bot.

Time Master is a time stewardship system that:
	•	Watches your calendar
	•	Tracks whether you actually do what you scheduled
	•	Helps you recover when reality changes
	•	Logs truth instead of intention

It exists to protect your time, not entertain you.

⸻

2. What Time Master Is NOT

Do not use Time Master as:
	•	A general conversation partner
	•	A spiritual counsellor
	•	A motivational coach
	•	A free-form assistant

If you talk to it like a human friend, you will get confusing responses.
This is expected behaviour, not a bug.

⸻

3. The One Rule You Must Follow

If it is not on the calendar, Time Master does not manage it.

Everything starts and ends with calendar time blocks.

⸻

4. Your Daily Usage Pattern (Mandatory)

Morning (1–2 minutes)

Purpose: Know what you actually committed to.

Command:

SUMMARY today

What this does:
	•	Lists today’s time blocks
	•	Shows what Time Master will steward

If something is wrong, fix it immediately:
	•	“Move Dev Stream to 14:30”
	•	“Cancel Script of the Day today”
	•	“Add Bible Study at 07:00 for 30 minutes”

⸻

During the Day (Live Execution)

Time Master is active during scheduled blocks.

You interact with it only when something changes.

⸻

Case 1: You are doing what you planned

✅ Do nothing.

Time Master assumes execution unless told otherwise.

⸻

Case 2: You switch tasks (pivot)

Command:

IM DOING <new activity>

Example:

IM DOING fixing Ruoth API bug

What this does:
	•	Logs a pivot
	•	Preserves honesty
	•	Prevents silent drift

No explanation required.

⸻

Case 3: You need more time

Command:

NEED MORE <title> <minutes>

Example:

NEED MORE Dev Stream 15

What this does:
	•	Extends the current block (if possible)
	•	Reflows softer blocks later
	•	Treats recovery as normal

⸻

Case 4: You finished the block

Command:

DONE <title>

Example:

DONE Dev Stream

What this does:
	•	Marks completion
	•	Feeds future reviews
	•	Builds execution history

⸻

Case 5: You didn’t start the block

Command:

DIDNT START <title>

Example:

DIDNT START Script of the Day

What this does:
	•	Logs non-completion
	•	Enables recovery later
	•	Avoids self-deception

⸻

5. Evening Usage (2–5 minutes)

Purpose: Close the day cleanly.

Command:

WHAT DID I MISS today

Optional:

SUMMARY tomorrow

That is all you need to do.

No journalling.
No explaining yourself.
Just truth.

⸻

6. Commands You Are Allowed to Use (Stick to These)

Status & Execution

DONE <title>
DIDNT START <title>

Time Control

NEED MORE <title> <minutes>
SNOOZE 5

Drift / Pivot

IM DOING <something else>

Awareness

SUMMARY today
WHAT DID I MISS today
WHAT’S ON NOW
WHAT’S NEXT

Scheduling (Plain English)
	•	“Add Piano Practice today at 18:30 for 30 minutes”
	•	“Move Ruoth build to 10:00”
	•	“Cancel Bible Study today”

⸻

7. Things You Should NOT Say (Very Important)

Do not say:
	•	“hi”
	•	“hey”
	•	“how are you”
	•	“who are you”
	•	“yes”
	•	“do it”

These trigger fallback behaviour and reduce clarity.

Time Master is command-first, not conversational.

⸻

8. How This Supports BEIA (Practically)

Time Master supports all 8 areas of your life the same way:

Area	How it helps
Faith	Protects time blocks
Business	Prevents silent drift
Development	Enforces focus windows
Content	Holds broadcast commitments
Music	Turns practice into reality
Family	Defends non-work time
Health	Keeps habits scheduled
Leadership	Shows what actually happened

It does not prioritise for you yet.
It records reality so you can lead.

⸻

9. What Is Working Right Now (Use With Confidence)

✅ Live session stewardship
✅ Calendar-driven reminders
✅ Pivot detection
✅ Recovery (extend / snooze)
✅ Completion & miss logging
✅ Daily summaries
✅ Drift detection loop

These passed tests and are safe to rely on.

⸻

10. What Is NOT Ready (Ignore for Now)

Do not expect these yet:
	•	Deep conversational flow
	•	Faith coaching dialogue
	•	Automatic goal planning
	•	Income tracking
	•	Long-term memory insights
	•	Silence tolerance polish

These are known xfails, not broken promises.

⸻

11. Your One-Week Evaluation Checklist

At the end of the week, answer:
	1.	Which blocks did Time Master protect best?
	2.	Where did it reduce mental load?
	3.	Where did it confuse you?
	4.	Which command did you use most?
	5.	One moment it saved your day
	6.	One thing you wanted but couldn’t do

This is how the system improves.

⸻

12. Final Rule (Non-Negotiable)

Tell the truth to the system, even when it’s uncomfortable.

Time Master only works if reality is logged.
